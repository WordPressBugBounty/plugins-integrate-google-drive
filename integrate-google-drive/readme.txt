## Data Privacy

When you use the built-in app to authenticate and link your Google Drive account, the Application collects the following information:

1. Your WordPress website URL.
2. A short-lived authorization code generated during the OAuth flow.

This data is collected only after you grant access via the Google OAuth consent screen. Upon consent, you’ll be redirected through the SoftLab BD server (`https://softlabbd.com/integrate-google-drive-oauth.php`), which then redirects you back to your site to complete the authorization. This intermediate redirect enables a simplified plugin setup without requiring you to create your own Google App or configure your own Authorized Redirect URI.

[SoftLab Privacy Policy](https://softlabbd.com/privacy-policy/)

**Important:**
After authorization, all communications occur directly between your server and the cloud storage servers over encrypted channels. No data passes through or is stored on our servers, and we do not access or collect your files.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. I have purchased a plan, but it still shows the free plan. What should I do? =
After purchase, you should receive a confirmation email containing the PRO download link and license key. If you did not receive it due to email delivery issues, you can access your PRO download and license key from the [Freemius Customer Portal](https://users.freemius.com/store/1760/).

This setup offers a user-friendly interface where clients can easily choose files, tag them with custom labels for better organization, and submit their selections. You’ll receive these submissions via email or can view them directly within the module’s selection management area.
